```
div.container>h2+ul.list-wrapper>li.item-list>lorem2
```
> This one-liner syntax will create a **container** div with a **h2** and **ul** children. 
> 1. The dot notation after a tag **.className** will create a class and **#idName** will create an id to the element.
> 2. The asterisk notation after a tag **asterisk(n)** creates multiple element base on **(n)**.
> 3. The **>** symbol creates element inward and **+** sysmbol create new sibling element.
